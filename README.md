# nix home manager configuration

This is my Nix HomeManager configuration and it's written in PureNix. Nix is a great tool and the nix language is a great purely functional language. However, it is untyped. PureScript was originally intended to compile to JavaScript, indeed it's a very Haskell like language with some modifications (e.g. record types) that make it easier to directly compile to readable JavaScript. PureScript was also designed to easily support other compilation backends than JavaScript. PureNix is one of them, it compiles PureScript to Nix.
